**Data Analysis & Visualization**

You have been provided with a dataset containing information about customer orders from an online retail store. The dataset includes fields such as customer ID, order date, product category, quantity, unit price, and
total price. Your task is to explore, analyze, and visualize the dataset to gain insights into customer purchasing
behavior and identify trends that could inform business decisions.

**Dataset Source:** You can use the "Online Retail" dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The
dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail

For this task you are required to carry out the following:

1. Explore the dataset

a. How will you examine the structure of the dataset and understand the meaning of the attributes?

b. How will you identify any missing values, outliers or any other issues that need to be addressed before
analysis?

c. How will you select the programming language and necessary tools and libraries for analysis and
visualization?

2. Analyze the dataset

Apply appropriate statistical techniques to support your analysis. This may involve calculating summary
statistics, performing hypothesis tests, or conducting regression analysis to explore relationships between
variables.

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to answer the following questions:

a. What are the most popular product categories based on the number of orders or total revenue?

b. Are there any seasonal trends in customer purchasing behavior?

c. Is there a correlation between the quantity of items ordered and their unit price?

d. Are there any significant differences in customer spending based on different demographic attributes
(e.g. age, location)?

3. Visualize the dataset

Create visualizations to effectively communicate your findings. Ensure that the visualizations accurately
represent the data and are visually appealing.

a. Consider the types of visualization and suitability for different types of data attributes - such as bar
charts, line charts, scatter plots, or heatmaps.

b. How will you carry out mapping the data attributes to visualization elements?

c. What libraries will you use and why have you selected them?
